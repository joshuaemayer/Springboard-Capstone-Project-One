0,4.5,"Our Year round blueberry brew is a hybrid Kolsh style. Fermented at colder temperatures, but using our American Ale strain minimizes conflicting fruity esters. We feel that the addition of juice from real, hand pressed, Rhode Island Blueberries shouldn?t have to compete with the natural fruit background of the yeast. Pale Malt makes up the base of the grist bill, but this brew also calls for a large amount of malted wheat, an ingredient that lends a soft mouthfeel to the beer. Further there is enough caramalt to ensure a sweetness everyone will enjoy.

The brewing methods of those days are a mystery and, although there are many theories, no one can say with certainty why the word ""steam"" came to be associated with beer.
