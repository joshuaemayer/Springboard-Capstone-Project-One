0,5.2,"Styles ? a consumer?s best friend, a brewer?s set of shackles! Though we have settled for Golden Ale on the label, Gabriel simply doesn?t quite fit into any existing style. It?s always a little more X or a little less Y. Perhaps it needs some Z? Whatever Gabriel isn?t doesn?t matter. Here?s what it is.
Gabriel is straw to pale golden colour, with a sweet biscuit malt base, and of course a good dosing of New Zealand?s finest aromatic hops, giving enticing aroma and flavour notes of gooseberry, citrus and a hint of peach. Almost a Golden Ale, Not quite a New World Pilsner, it?s Gabriel and we?re pretty sure you will like it.
