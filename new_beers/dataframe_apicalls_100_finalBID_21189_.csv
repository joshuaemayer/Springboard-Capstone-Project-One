0,5.3,"St. Norbert follows the tradition of cooking ales - wheat beers in Bohemia. This beer is manufactured using the oldest procedure for beer cooking ? top fermentation ? documented in our territory from 505 when Petr Vok of Ro?mberk granted to the Town of T?ebov? the right to cook ales. Wheat beers are currently experiencing a renaissance, and they are loved for their lightness and freshness, especially in summer months. Also, the fans of less bitter beer love it for its low content of hops.

This beer is non-filtered, with a content of ale yeasts causing dullness and, furthermore, with a content of wheat malt (50%) which causes the light color. The yeast of the natural top fermentation produces esters and phenols, which develop a wide palette of aromatic tones and flavors. For example, we can find here ? rose-apple, nutmeg apple, vanilla, bananas and from citruses to smoked scents. Czech beers of the Pilsen type are characteristic with their typical bitterness (35?45 units of bitterness) are an opposite to wheat beers, which have 10?17 units of bitterness.

0,5.0,"Probably the best beer in the world, and the flagship brand in Carlsberg Group's portfolio. A regular in millions of bars across 140 countries worldwide, it is a truly international beer brand.

Hordeum vulgare. That?s the Latin name for barley, but there?s nothing vulgar about it. In fact, it is a rather special malting barley we use. We have our own Barley Breeding Group, which works in close contact with our brewmasters.

The group selects the barley with the best traits and grows it in our research fields, using only traditional breeding methods, 100% free of genetic modifications. Considering that Carlsberg is made from 100% pure malt i.e. no adjuncts it could take some years before we breed the necessary amount of barley. Probably worth the effort.

Hops are our secret ingredient. Of course it is no secret that we use hops in our beer, but the types we use are prepared according to a secret recipe that?s exclusive to us. It?s called the Carlsberg Aroma Hop Extract and nobody but us at Carlsberg can use it. After all, there can only be one best beer in the world.

Yeast is at the heart of our history. In 1879, Carlsberg was the first brewery to produce a purified brewer?s yeast, the Saccharomyces Carlsbergensis. Since then we?ve been constantly working to improve our yeast?s taste and the stability of our beer. We do it by using a classic breeding method, which means it can take up to 20 trials and several years to obtain a new yeast strain that?s good enough for brewing",8,https://untappd.akamaized.net/site/beer_logos/beer-5991_8dbe6_sm.jpeg,https://untappd.akamaized.net/site/beer_logos_hd/beer-5991_716e4_hd.jpeg,Carlsberg,carlsberg-group-carlsberg,Lager - Euro,5991,344,https://untappd.akamaized.net/site/brewery_logos/brewery-CarlsbergBrewery_344.jpeg,Carlsberg Group,carlsberg-group,Macro Brewery,http://www.facebook.com/Carlsberg,carlsberggroup,www.carlsberggroup.com,Denmark,Copenhagen,,55.6673,12.535,"Sat, 02 Oct 2010 20:40:53 +0000",0,1,5991.0,"Mon, 19 Dec 2011 19:36:52 +0000",21123.0,128610,2.98889,,4481,268587,149261,0,,,,,,0.0,[],2.99046,False

Our fruit is pressed at the peak of ripeness, and fermented for nearly a year, using a traditional French style of in-bottle fermentation.
The in-bottle fermentation achieves a natural carbonation, with a bubble similar to champagne, and an alcohol content of about 6.5%.

Nektar flavored dark beer is definitely an innovation in the region and quite a surprise after lemon, grapefruit and pineapple. However, black currant is often used in the brewing industry as a supplement to beers, mainly in ales and fruit beers.
