Stylistically, the malt side is very English, but the hops are all floral US varieties. Brewed with only the best including: 2-row Pilsner malt, Flaked Barley, UK Crystal Malt, and a touch of UK Chocolate Malt. We use Columbus hops in the brew kettle, and dry hop with Cascade and Willamette.

0,4.0,"From the cherry tree?s transient flowers, its fruits ripen ? round, red and packed with sunshine. Timmermans Kriek blends its famed lambic with this sweetness for a beer that can quench any thirst. Its natural freshness will make you blush for joy.

Its flavour is all cherry, as is already apparent from its very powerful nose. Its acidity is neutralised by its agreeably sweet and fruity bouquet. Its taste pervades the mouth and lingers gently, elegantly tinted with summer cherries.?
