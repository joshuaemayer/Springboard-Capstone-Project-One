0,4.0,"East Coast Ale, is our South African inspired beer. Most of the year ShongweniValley and the nearby City of Durban are bathed in warm, sub-tropical sunshine, but we do get the odd surprise from Summer storms that refresh the air and make the bush grow again. The people of this area are exciting, diverse and full of energy and optimism. We wanted to capture this spirit of the East Coast in our beer and we think we have. East Coast Ale is a lively, refreshing, smooth, golden ale. We make East Coast Ale using a single malt variety and two kinds of hops, Brewers Gold and Challenger. Brewers Gold provides an excellent balanced bitterness especially when combined with a late aroma hop in golden beers. We achieve this using Challenger hops to give a crisp, fruity character, resulting in a beer with around 25 bitterness units and an ABV of 4%. This beer is fermented using a special ale yeast that imparts its own character to the beer.

0,3.5,"Chapter Three, our Fruit Beer, is strongly influenced by the monastic brewers from Belgium. We use both malted barley and unmalted wheat together with Hallertau and Saaz hops to create our base beer for our different seasonal fruit beers. While the European brewers may have a preference for Cherry beers we wanted to use only locally grown fruits in our beers. Depending on the time of year we will brew with either pineapple, strawberry, or more commonly the local mangos which grow throughout Shongweni Valley. We only use whole fruits to produce our beer, and we use a lot of it too, no extracts or flavourings here. This is always appreciated, not only by those who drink our beer but also by the lucky pigs who get a nice fruit supplement to their normal malt or wheat diet from our spent grains. The colour of the beer depends on the fruit that we use but all have a great natural carbonation and good head on the beer when poured.

0,5.7,"Durban Pale Ale was inspired by the original IPAs produced in Britain and then shipped to India for consumption by the officers and bureaucrats. The IPA came via the Cape and records show that some of that beer made its way to the British serving in South Africa. With Durban then, as now, a major shipping port it is hard not to believe that barrels of IPA were happily consumed here on the East Coast, so we wanted to revive an old tradition. We only use the best malts for our Pale Ale, and in order to achieve our 5.7% ABV we need to pack the mash tun full of grains. The beer is also crammed full of hops to achieve the 40 units of bitterness that we want. We use Cascade hops since they don?t leave any lingering bitterness or harshness on the palate. The inclusion of Challenger hops provide the crisp, fruitiness characteristic of the beer, which is complimented by the special strain of English ale yeast that we use to ferment the beer. Our Durban Pale Ale is a strong beer and we have found that its character will change over time if cellared, producing an even more complex ale.",45,https://untappd.akamaized.net/site/assets/images/temp/badge-beer-default.png,,Durban Pale Ale,shongweni-brewery-durban-pale-ale,IPA - English,14473,3804,https://untappd.akamaized.net/site/brewery_logos/brewery-ShongweniBrewery_3804.jpeg,Shongweni Brewery,shongweni-brewery,Micro Brewery,http://www.facebook.com/pages/Shongweni-Brewery/125852340780809,RobsonsRealBeer,http://www.shongwenibrewery.com/index.html,South Africa,Hillcrest,Kwazulu-Natal,-29.7716,30.7568,,,"Sun, 12 Dec 2010 18:02:32 +0000",0,1,,,,253,3.31324,,1,345,279,0,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,[],3.49797,False

0,11.4,"Riserva is an American Wild Ale fermented on red raspberries. Riserva is fermented with a blend of Saccharomyces yeast, Brettanomyces yeast and lactic acid bacteria that produce funky, sour and fruity flavors and aromas.
The beer is aged for more than a year in oak barrels with raspberries, giving the beer a pungent raspberry aroma, a lovely red color and a balancing wood character. This brew is a beautiful beer both to your eyes and to your taste buds. The microflora responsible for giving Riserva its character reside in the wood barrels and change somewhat over time depending upon factors such as the age of the barrel and the ambient temperature at which the barrels are stored. New barrels are rotated into the mix as old barrels are rotated out and as such, Riserva varies somewhat in color and tartness from year to year. Riserva is much higher in alcohol than its Belgian lambic framboise cousins and is a true treat to experience.
Each year, the microflora produce a slightly different beer so we vintage date them.
