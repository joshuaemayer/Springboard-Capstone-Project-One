0,12.0,"SPECIAL COMMEMORATIVE BEER

Former brewer Ken Pajak teamed up with MSBC to create a very special beer to celebrate the 10 years that he and wife Shauna have owned Caf?? Amsterdam. Since taking over this mid-town establishment, the Pajaks added a ???beer & wine license??? and subsequently transformed the European-style caf?? into a beer-centric place to grab breakfast, lunch, dinner and all beers during, around and between these fabulous meals. 

The cafe's beer menu is extensive and all-encompassing. The staff is knowledgeable and enthusiastic. And the beer pour is always right??? temperature, glass, presentation. 

???No hops were harmed in the brewing of this beer.??? 

Gruit is an old style???one that incorporates spices, herbs and fruit but no hops. The latter detail makes this style very rare in modern times. Caf?? Amsterdam???s Gruit is dark, strong and interesting. This combination of pale and dark malts, sage, thyme, cinnamon, black peppercorn and fresh orange peel composes distinctive, substantial flavors that meld together wonderfully. And at 12% ABV, this cellar-friendly ale is ready to lay you down! Thoroughly enjoy this old-world beer now but stash some away for later dwelvings.

The dark color might lead you to believe the some malt may shine through; but no, the hops are the true player in this ale.

0,11.0,"Originally brewed for thirsty British troops stationed on the subcontinent of India, India Pale Ales had to withstand the sea voyage around Africa. Brewers need to take full advantage of two preservatives at the time: hops and alcohol. They increased their hopping rates, doubled  their malt useage to increase alcohol content, and dry-hopped the brew before it set out on its voyage.
Our Imperial IPA carries on this tradition- and then some!  The fruity and citrusy hop aroma intermingles perfectly with an assertive malty backbone.  Our brewers added a generous supply of hops to this brew throughout the entire process to provide an enormous hop flavor and balance the elevated alcohol content.

Brewery folklore tells of a train engineer with a passion for the taste of Railbender Ale. With every stop he made in Erie came an equal number of stops at our brewery. One extended visit to our fermenter left the engineer in a rather befuddled state of mind. On his fateful trip out of Erie that evening, his train mysteriously derailed. The engineer swears that a huge black cherry tree that had fallen across the tracks was the culprit. No such tree was ever found, but the front of the locomotive was spattered with hundreds of red spots. In tribute to this folklore, our expert brewers introduced Derailed Black Cherry Ale, brewed with fresh, sweet black cherries and the finest malted barley to create a truly cherrylicious ale. Please enjoy responsibly, as we never want you to become derailed.",17,https://untappd.akamaized.net/site/beer_logos/beer-5621_7a4c5_sm.jpeg,https://untappd.akamaized.net/site/beer_logos_hd/beer-5621_e3ada_hd.jpeg,Derailed Black Cherry Ale,erie-brewing-company-derailed-black-cherry-ale,Fruit Beer,5621,507,https://untappd.akamaized.net/site/brewery_logos/brewery-507_ddbc2.jpeg,Erie Brewing Company,erie-brewing-company,Micro Brewery,https://www.facebook.com/ErieBrewingCo/,eriebrewingco,http://www.eriebrewingco.com,United States,Erie,PA,42.1114,-80.1129,"Sat, 21 Aug 2010 09:26:35 +0000",0,1,,,,10837,3.172,,152,14223,12016,0,,,,,,,0.0,[],3.18515,False
