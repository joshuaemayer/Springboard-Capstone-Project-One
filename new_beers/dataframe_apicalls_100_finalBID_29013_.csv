Think you don't like Stout? Try this one. Think you don't like any kind of beer? Try this one.
We can't tell you how many times we've heard both declarations from the mouths of our customers and low and behold... they try this beer and are saved from a life of bad beer or no beer at all.
Can I get a witness?
Lift a glass of this dry stout up to your nose and breathe in the decadent aroma of dark chocolate emanating from the creamy off-white to tan-colored head. Take a sip and feel the familiar warmth of roasted coffee that goes down smooth. A lighter body than your average stout makes this one a house favorite - our best-selling beer, in fact. So throw off your shackles! Come to the House of the Pour. And you just might find salvation in a glass of Revelations!

0,5.5,"Petoskey Pale is a liquid ode to our great state, an attempt to represent the unique character of Michigan in a bottle of living beer. This quintessentially Michigan beer is named after the state stone. Petoskey stones are actually fossilized coral freed by glacial activity, and can be found in sand dunes and beaches at the top of lower Michigan, near the town of the same name. Both are named after the community started by Ottawa Indian Chief Ignatius Petosega, so our name is a nod to the native culture we so respect. We even put a number of petoskey stones around the large wooden cask during aging, more to impart the soul of the land than an actual flavor. This drink is so steeped in history and complex in flavor that we think of it as a style all to it's own - one we call Michigan Grand Cru Pale Ale. 

As soon as it's poured into a glass the difference between this and other pale ales is evident. A tall head rushes to the top of the glass, becoming quite rocky as it settles. The aroma is lively, with more of a farmhouse character than other pales, but the citrus hop notes are dominant. By this point the ale's origins at the Jolly Pumpkin Brewery are evident: the wild yeasts that inhabit the brewhouse give an unmistakable character. On the palate this beer has a perfect balance between the sweet apricot notes from the malt, the complex hoppiness, and wild, slightly tangy character from the time in barrel. More herbaceous than floral on the finish, but refreshing nonetheless.",0,https://untappd.akamaized.net/site/beer_logos/beer-Petoskeypaleale_28967.jpeg,,Petoskey Pale Ale,leelanau-brewing-company-petoskey-pale-ale,Pale Ale - Belgian,28967,5356,https://untappd.akamaized.net/site/brewery_logos/brewery-LeelanauBrewingCompany_5356.jpeg,Leelanau Brewing Company,leelanau-brewing-company,Micro Brewery,,,http://www.leelanaubeer.com/,United States,Lake Leelanau,MI,44.993,-85.7696,"Sun, 06 Feb 2011 03:47:58 +0000",0,1,,,,685,3.74781,,4,906,828,0,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,[],3.71795,False
