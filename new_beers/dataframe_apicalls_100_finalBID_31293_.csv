Aromas of strong dark chocolate, a little fruitiness from the hops and yeast and some rumminess from the alcohol. The flavour is an intense hit of mocha - bitter dark chocolate bordering on coffee. Some malt sweetness but an aggressive hop bitterness.

0,6.2,"Your father?s red ale was pretty to look at but not much to drink, seriously in need of a personality transplant. But over the years, red ales have turned into the real deal, with a character as lively and big as any pale ale. Reppin? Red blends seven malts for layer upon layer of caramel and toasted toffee with the uniquely peppery spiciness of rye and tops it all off with a mix of selected Pacific Northwest hops, chosen for their lively flavors and sophisticated aromas of flowers, pine and citrus. It?s a big beer that demands big food. Reppin? Red is fantastic with grilled meat and steaks, and totally rocks a burger.

0,5.5,"This is an India Brown Ale, a newer style classification created by the American craft brew revolution. Based loosely upon the traditional IPA, this beer is more American and a hybrid of a traditional brown ale and American pale ale. Being highly hopped with Cascade and Centennial hops gives it a floral aroma and finish. Hints of roastiness found behind the hop-forward flavor comes from a very slight addition of roasted barley, which makes it brown in color, too.
