This beer is made with 40% wheat malt and is brewed with a special yeast that tends to stay in suspension, giving the beer its cloudy appearance. Bavarians are so convinced of the healthful qualities of this yeasty brew that doctors there are known to prescribe two Hefeweizens a day to feeble patients. The yeast used for this brew also imparts its unique spicy, clovey flavour. Some people even detect a light banana flavour.

India Pale Ale dates back to the 1700???s when Britain needed a hearty beer to ship to her troops in India. Because the ships had to cross the equator twice to get there, spoilage was a major problem until some clever brewer realized that both alcohol and hops are natural preservatives. James brews Hurricane I.P.A. in this tradition, and packs it with enough hops and alcohol to survive crossing the orbit of Mercury twice. The grist is 100% Gambrinus premium 2-row barley malt, copiously hopped with fresh Centennial and Willamette.
