A pislner-style ale, Single Chair is brewed with pilsner malt and Hallertau hops.

HISTORY
Behind great beer there is a brewer, and behind great beef there is a bull. Fukutsuru (Fuku to his friends) is that bull. Ranked the top marbling bull in the U.S., Fuku is a Japanese Wagyu bull whose offspring produce premium grade American Kobe Beef that is served with St. Rogue Red. Over 50,000 units of Fuku?s pride is in the freezer for future breeding. In his final days, Fuku was given the opportunity to ?socialize? with some fine, young cows. Instead, he chose to take a nap. We dedicate this beer to Fuku ? a rogue to the very end.

Food Pairing: Beef, Seafood

HISTORY
Dedicated to Justin Fisch, the Shade Man, and the official beer of the Rogue Nation. Brutal combines Oregon hops with English Malts. The Oregon grown Crystal hop is a triploid variety developed from the German Hallertau aroma hop variety with contributions from Cascade, Brewers Gold, and Early Green. Crystal is the only hop used in brewing Brutal and it provides a massive amount of aroma without dry-hopping.

HISTORY
Dedicated to the homebrewer in each of us! The homebrewer who inspired this creation is Chris Studach, a friend of Rogue?s resident wizard John Maier, who added a Northwest twist to the classic style by adding hazelnuts for the host homebrew at the 1993 American Homebrewers Association
convention. Chris put the nut in nut brown!

Rogues Honey Cream Ale is a light, smooth, medium bodied ale, with a creamy head, hints of honey and a crisp light finish. Brewed with two-row Harrington, Klages and Munich malts and Crystal hops.

HISTORY
The creation of India Pale Ale (IPA) during the early 1700s was the result of tremendous efforts by British brewers to overcome a difficult problem: during the 1700s beer did not keep well on long ocean voyages, especially into hot climates. These hot environments resulted in the arrival of flat, sour beer.

HISTORY

The Turkey was named the official bird of the Rogue Nation in August 2007. To commemorate the momentous occasion, Rogue Juniper Pale Ale was dedicated to ?the turkey in each of us.? An axe and the dedication have been added to the serigraphed 22oz bottle and Juniper Pale Ale tap stickers.

The Pilgrims were ale drinkers and most likely enjoyed beer at the first Thanksgiving. Juniper Pale Ale, like all Rogue products preserves water by using more ingredients, contains no chemicals, additives or preservatives and uses Free Range Coastal Water.
