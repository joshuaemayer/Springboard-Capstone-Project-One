0,5.6,"Aspen Brewing Company?s first real ?seasonal? offering was our Spring Blonde Wheat Ale, which made its debut during the spring season of ?09.  It was released without fanfare or publicity, but despite this under-the-radar status, it was a hit. Like, a huge hit.  Such a hit in fact that its name on our menu in the tasting room was magically changed to Summer Blonde Wheat Ale as the temps warmed up through the late spring into the early summer.  So, guess what?s happened now ? the Blonde has become a year-round offering known as ?This Season?s Blonde?!  Hooray! Every season should involve a Blonde, right?

Similar to our Smuggler Wheat Hefeweizen-styled Ale, this This Season?s Blonde beauty is a Wheat Ale, however it does have some notable differences to our favorite Hefeweizen.  First and foremost, where Smuggler Wheat is a cloudy, yeasty, and nutrient-rich ale, This Season?s Blonde is served clear, with playful carbonation leading to wonderful head and beautiful lace along the side of your pint glass. This Season?s Blonde goes down dangerously easily, but you won?t be disappointed! We have been told by our local regulars that This Season?s Blonde is a bit more floral, citrusy, and generally ?hoppy? than Smuggler Wheat, which the Aspen Brew Crew agrees with ? though don?t be scared, its not bitter like Independence Pass Ale or Conundrum Red.",24,https://untappd.akamaized.net/site/beer_logos/beer-_29519_sm_457f068347385d5d8cbde7a37aaae9.jpeg,,This Season's Blonde,aspen-brewing-company-this-season-s-blonde,Pale Wheat Ale - American,29519,4835,https://untappd.akamaized.net/site/brewery_logos/brewery-AspenBrewingCompany_4835.jpeg,Aspen Brewing Company,aspen-brewing-company,Micro Brewery,http://www.facebook.com/AspenBrewingCompany,AspenBrewingCo,http://www.aspenbrewingcompany.com,United States,Aspen,CO,39.1903,-106.82,"Wed, 09 Feb 2011 21:51:09 +0000",0,1,,,,3579,3.45879,,35,4678,4024,0,,,,,,,0.0,[],3.47389,False

Brewed with tons of Roasted, Chocolate, and Black malts, balanced with a heavy dose of delicious and earthy Fuggle hops, this porter is just what the not-afraid-of-the-dark (beer drinking) person is looking for. When Aspen Brewery?s head brewer, Terry Butler expressed interest in brewing a porter, it didn?t take much convincing to follow through with one. After all, Terry has won medals for porters at the Great American Brew Festival in years past! What poured out of our tap that first day the porter was ready was nothing short of euphoria.

Aspen is nestled between two enormous mountain ranges, the Elk Mountains, and the Sawatch Range. These two ranges are home to some of Colorado?s highest mountains, known as ?fourteeners? as their altitude is above fourteen thousand feet ? there are many within a short distance from Aspen, but one of the most breathtaking to behold is surely Pyramid Peak. Impressive aesthetically, Pyramid and its neighbors the Maroon Bells are also some of the most difficult fourteeners to climb. We couldn?t help but name a badass beer after this badass mountain.
