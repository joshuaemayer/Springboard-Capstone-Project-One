Tasting Notes
A truly classic old-world pilsner beer;  the 1845 Pils starts with a light malt aroma followed by a floral hop scent.  The crisp, clean and well-rounded taste leaves just a subtle touch of bitterness that rolls lightly on the sides of the tongue and is refreshed and cleansed with each sip.
