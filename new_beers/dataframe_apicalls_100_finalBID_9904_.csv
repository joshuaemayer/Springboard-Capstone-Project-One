The brew represents a truly unique American beer style known as California common. This San Francisco style lager is a deep amber color, full of malty goodness and assertively hopped for an exceptionally balanced and smooth beer. This brew marries the full malt character of ale with the smoothness of lager. This beer goes great with just about any food, but try it with your favorite entree slathered in BBQ sauce or a spicy Asian dish. Serve cold, of course.",50,https://untappd.akamaized.net/site/beer_logos/beer-Element115Lager_9844.jpeg,,Element 115 Lager,flat-earth-brewing-company-element-115-lager,California Common,9844,531,https://untappd.akamaized.net/site/brewery_logos/brewery-FlatEarthBrewingCompany_531.jpeg,Saint Paul's Flat Earth Brewing Company,saint-paul-s-flat-earth-brewing-company,Micro Brewery,http://www.facebook.com/pages/Flat-Earth-Brewing-Company/36142542091,flatearthbrew,http://flatearthbrewing.com,United States,St. Paul,MN,44.9626,-93.0716,,,"Thu, 18 Nov 2010 15:32:18 +0000",0,1,,,,912,3.38706,,4,1169,1063,0,,,,,,,0.0,[],3.45331,False
