The brewers at Lazy Magnolia have combined the two most southern flavors, pecans and bourbon! It is the first bourbon barrel aged beer ever to be produced in the State of Mississippi, and supply is limited.

The flavor of the bourbon warms the palate, and the toasted oak barrel enhances the natural vanilla flavors in the beer. The beer is extremely smooth and easy drinking.

0,9.0,"Belgian Strong Ale Brewed with White Grapes

Victoria Ale was inspired by a visit to Victoria Mansion, in Portland, Maine and the visual references to Bacchus, the god of wine. The brewer's decided to fuse the worlds of beer and wine. Over two hundred pounds of Chardonnay (Vidal Blanc in 2010) grapes were brought in, crushed on site and added directly to the mash. Victoria Ale's aroma is fruity spice, and the taste presents subtle notes of green banana, black pepper, and fresh-crushed mint. With a focus on the subtle, wine-like character of the grapes, the 9.0% ABV brew boasts a pale copper color, Belgian yeast influence, and a medium body with a long candied fruit finish with hints of honeydew melon, and, of course, white wine grapes.
*Money generated by the brewing of Victoria will go to the National Historic Landmark, Victoria Mansion here in Portland, Maine. Also known as the Morse-Libby House, it is one of the greatest 19th century houses in the United States. Designed by architect Henry Austin, the mansion was built between 1858 and 1860 and survives as a unique example of the princely palaces created for America's wealthiest citizens in the pre-Civil War era. The Victoria Mansion has operated as a museum since it was saved from demolition in 1940, and today the non-profit organization that owns it remains committed to its preservation and interpretation to a wide audience.",0,https://untappd.akamaized.net/site/beer_logos/beer-21637_23f8e_sm.jpeg,https://untappd.akamaized.net/site/beer_logos_hd/beer-21637_3f8bb_hd.jpeg,Victoria,allagash-brewing-company-victoria,Belgian Strong Golden Ale,21637,24,https://untappd.akamaized.net/site/brewery_logos/brewery-24_015ad.jpeg,Allagash Brewing Company,allagash-brewing-company,Micro Brewery,https://www.facebook.com/pages/Allagash-Brewing-Company/111357972232101?ref=ts&fref=ts,allagashbrewing,http://allagash.com,United States,Portland,ME,43.7028,-70.3182,"Wed, 05 Jan 2011 12:37:09 +0000",0,1,,,,6767,3.8199,,189,8514,7902,0,,,,,,5.0,"[{'beer': {'bid': 119022, 'beer_label': 'https://untappd.akamaized.net/site/beer_logos/beer-21637_23f8e_sm.jpeg', 'beer_slug': 'allagash-brewing-company-victoria-2011', 'beer_name': 'Victoria (2011)', 'is_vintage': 1, 'is_variant': 0}}, {'beer': {'bid': 153777, 'beer_label': 'https://untappd.akamaized.net/site/beer_logos/beer-21637_23f8e_sm.jpeg', 'beer_slug': 'allagash-brewing-company-victoria-2010', 'beer_name': 'Victoria (2010)', 'is_vintage': 1, 'is_variant': 0}}, {'beer': {'bid': 154477, 'beer_label': 'https://untappd.akamaized.net/site/beer_logos/beer-21637_23f8e_sm.jpeg', 'beer_slug': 'allagash-brewing-company-victoria-2009', 'beer_name': 'Victoria (2009)', 'is_vintage': 1, 'is_variant': 0}}, {'beer': {'bid': 182741, 'beer_label': 'https://untappd.akamaized.net/site/beer_logos/beer-21637_23f8e_sm.jpeg', 'beer_slug': 'allagash-brewing-company-victoria-2012', 'beer_name': 'Victoria (2012)', 'is_vintage': 1, 'is_variant': 0}}, {'beer': {'bid': 186884, 'beer_label': 'https://untappd.akamaized.net/site/beer_logos/beer-21637_23f8e_sm.jpeg', 'beer_slug': 'allagash-brewing-company-victoria-2006', 'beer_name': 'Victoria (2006)', 'is_vintage': 1, 'is_variant': 0}}]",3.81261,False
