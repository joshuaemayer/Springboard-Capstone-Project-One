Scotch Ales traditionally go through a long boil in the kettle for a caramelization of the wort. This produces a deep copper to brown in colored brew. Compared to Scottish Ales, they'll be sweeter and fuller-bodied, and of course higher in alcohol, with a much more pronounced malty caramel and roasted malt flavor. A low tea-like bitterness can be found in many examples. 

Description: Kilted Badger is a deep amber to mahogany colored ale with caramel and toffee aromas intertwined with a mild fruitiness. This full bodied scotch ale is hearty and smooth and accented with a touch of hops for balance. The Badger finishes with a mild sweetness.

Tavistock Estate is built on the site of the Cotterell Brickworks. Looking at Old Maps shows the brickworks were built some time between 1882 and 1899.

During the Second World War, brickmaking was not a priority so the brickworks closed in 1939 and never reopened.",0,https://untappd.akamaized.net/site/beer_logos/beer-Brickworks_28862.jpeg,,Brickworks Bitter,binghams-brewery-brickworks-bitter,English Bitter,28862,6299,https://untappd.akamaized.net/site/brewery_logos/brewery-BinghamsBrewery_6299_e6a40.jpeg,Binghams Brewery,binghams-brewery,Micro Brewery,https://www.facebook.com/binghamsbrewery,binghamsbrewery,http://www.binghams.co.uk,England,Ruscombe,Berkshire,51.466,-1.2814,"Sun, 06 Feb 2011 00:05:21 +0000",0,1,,,,479,3.45094,,16,638,533,0,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,[],3.52881,False
