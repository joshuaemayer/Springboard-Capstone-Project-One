0,5.9,"In 1989, Lakefront Brewery owner, Russ Klisch was reading dusty brewing tome, tipping one of our fine lagers and came across a beer recipe that Thomas Jefferson had brewed with pumpkin at his home in Monticello.
Lakefront Brewery?s Pumpkin Lager is one-of-the only pumpkin lagers available in the world; all other pumpkin beers are ales. Using real pumpkin and a proprietary blend of spices made here in Milwaukee for us by the acclaimed Spice House, our brewers lager this beer for 4 full weeks. This extra time gives Pumpkin Lager a deep, smooth richness that no ale can match. A frothy entry leads to an off-dry, medium-to-full body of intense cinnamon,
nutmeg, cardamom, and candied yam flavor on a nutty whole grain toast palate. Finishes with a drier spice and
light toffee fade. Caramel and Munich malts reinforce this beer?s mouthfeel and lend to the malty sweetness. A nicely balanced spice beer for those cool fall nights.
