Like the Pale Ale, the Headwall Alt is cold conditioned, dry-hopped and krausened in the bottle or keg. Similar to the Pale Ale, the process takes about 30 days.

0,8.7,"Gordon is a hybrid version of strong ale, somewhere between an Imperial Red and a Double IPA. We make it with six different malts and three types of hops, then dry-hop it with a mutha lode of Amarillo hops. It is 8.7% alcohol by volume, and has 85 International Bittering Units. 

It features a gooey, resiny aroma and a luscious mouthfeel. Gordon is brewed with dash of chocolate malt in it, to round out its load of hops and balance the beer. The result is an assertive yet exceptionally smooth version of strong beer.

We brew Gordon in tribute to the late Gordon Knight. In addition to opening some of Colorado???s first microbreweries, Knight was a Vietnam vet, grade-A citizen, and huge promoter of craft beer. He lost his life in 2002 while fighting a wild fire outside of Lyons, Colorado.

Originally our winter seasonal beer, it has become a cult favorite of extreme-beer lovers, so we now brew occasional batches of Gordon throughout the year. Released in bottles in 2003 and 2004, Gordon is now sold in four packs of hand-labeled cans and on draft in select markets.

HISTORY
The Morimoto Soba Ale is part of the new Signature Series of Rogue Ales, launched in the Spring of 2003 with internationally acclaimed Chef Masaharu Morimoto?a James Beard awarded chef and one of the stars of the Food Network series, Iron Chef.

Soba (also known as buckwheat) is not a type of wheat but a member of the rhubarb family and has been a longtime staple of Japanese cuisine because of its nutritional value. Buckwheat is high in potassium, phosphorous, vitamin B (50 percent more than wheat) and protein, and its virtually fat-free. The fruits of the buckwheat plant are like small beechnuts, which are milled to separate the edible groats from the dark brown hulls. The groats are then roasted and used more or less like a grain (a good example is Kasha).

?Work is the curse of the drinking classes.""

0,5.4,"Brewed in the tradition of the smoked ales of Bamberg (Germany), this amber ale has delicate malty and smoky aromas. It is full-bodied, malty and slightly sweet to the taste, and the smoky flavour is fully expressed with every draught. An original and distinctive beer, La Charbonni?re is a house specialty. It is very much appreciated by beer enthusiasts who happily discover a type of beer that is rarely available on the market.",0,https://untappd.akamaized.net/site/beer_logos/beer-Charbonniere_30194.jpeg,,Charbonni?re,brasserie-dieu-du-ciel-charbonniere,Rauchbier,30194,1674,https://untappd.akamaized.net/site/brewery_logos/brewery-1674_733d8.jpeg,Brasserie Dieu du Ciel!,brasserie-dieu-du-ciel,Micro Brewery,http://www.facebook.com/pages/Brasserie-Dieu-du-Ciel-la-page-officielle/104295439644026,Brasseries_DDC,http://dieuduciel.com/,Canada,St-J?r?me,QC,45.7752,-74.0016,"Sat, 12 Feb 2011 23:34:38 +0000",0,1,,,,1131,3.55614,,1,1529,1268,0,,,,,,0.0,[],3.57629,False
