Lips of Faith is all about taking chances, breaking rules and being experimental kind of like being back in high school. Eric won the quarterly drink-off qualifier by correctly identifying which three beers in what percentage had been blended in his glass, earning him the right to brew whatever kind of beer he chose.

Having worked closely with our wood beer project, La Folie, Eric decided to play around with oak barrels. The result is a very drinkable sour beer hybrid with subtle peach tones and a warm, spicy finish. The aroma has pleasant hints of vanilla and tropical fruit, the wood characteristics are present but nicely muted.

0,7.3,"Hopwired was one of the first, true new world IPAs made exclusively with unique NZ hops. In its short life time it has become a modern classic among Kiwi craft beers. Since then, many other IPAs have emerged but we dare say this is still somewhat the benchmark.

Although there is plenty of malt sweetness, this beer is all about the hops. Punchy, aggressive, New Zealand hops that all add up to create wonderful, tropical flavours and aromas. Wine people would talk about waves of pasionfruit, limes, tangelos * gooseberries. Luckily we don't have to go to such detail, so you can just enjoy it without further complication.

If you?re feeling politically incorrect try it with your favourite cigar, or a dram of your best single malt whisky. Or, if your tooth is sweeter, why not jump in at the deep end with the most decadent dessert of all; half a bottle in a glass with a generous scoop of vanilla ice cream on top (beer geeks like us know it as the Imperial Stout Float). Or simply enjoy it on its own as a decadent dessert or night cap - the perfect winter warmer!

Gabriel is straw to pale golden colour, with a sweet biscuit malt base, and of course a good dosing of New Zealand?s finest aromatic hops, giving enticing aroma and flavour notes of gooseberry, citrus and a hint of peach. Almost a Golden Ale, Not quite a New World Pilsner, it?s Gabriel and we?re pretty sure you will like it.
