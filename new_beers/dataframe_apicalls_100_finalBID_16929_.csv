HISTORY
Imperial Stout, also known as ?Russian Imperial Stout? is a variety of ale that was originally brewed in England for export to the court of the Tsar of Russia. Its high level of hopping is intended to preserve it during long trips and to provide a more bracing drink against cold climates. The colour is very dark, nearly opaque black. Imperial stout exhibits enormously powerful malt flavours, hints of dark fruits, and is often quite dry.

?He was a wise man who invented beer.?

The History
Named after Thomas Hobson Esq a Cambridge carrier who delivered mail between London and Cambridge. The stables were near St Catherine?s College in the centre of the city and when the horses were not delivering mail they were used by the students and staff of the university. Thomas Hobson noticed that the strongest and fastest horses were very popular and tended to be overworked. He devised a scheme whereby customers were offered the choice of the horse nearest to the door or none at all, renting his horses out in strict rotation. Hence there was no choice at all.",0,https://untappd.akamaized.net/site/beer_logos/beer-51207_4b626_sm.jpeg,https://untappd.akamaized.net/site/beer_logos_hd/beer-51207_3edf8_hd.jpeg,Hobsons Choice,city-of-cambridge-brewery-hobsons-choice,English Bitter,51207,11707,https://untappd.akamaized.net/site/brewery_logos/brewery-11707_b762d.jpeg,City of Cambridge Brewery,city-of-cambridge-brewery,Micro Brewery,,,http://www.cambridge-brewery.co.uk/,England,"Besthorpe, Attleborough","Norfolk, NR17 2LD",52.5326,1.05945,"Thu, 19 May 2011 00:40:01 +0000",0,1,51207.0,"Sat, 08 Dec 2012 17:08:35 +0000",16919.0,187,3.48797,,6,223,208,0,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,[],3.58891,False
